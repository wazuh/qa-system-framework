"""
Module to test the callback result of FileRegexMonitor.

When monitoring is started, each file line will be processed by a callback function, that will determine if the line
meets the condition to trigger it. In the case that the callback is triggered, the result is stored in an attribute
variable. In this module we check that behavior.

Test cases:
    - Write an event that matches with callback and check the returned callback group info.
